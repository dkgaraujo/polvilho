# Contributing

I started coding polvilho to have fun. If you want to come along and have fun too, here are some areas of interest and a minimalistic code of conduct.

## priority areas
- documentation
- porting over to other OSs
- adding tests
- adding more niche browsers

## contributor conduct
- be a nice person to the other contributor(s) and to polvilho user(s)
